# NatoManga Enhancer extension

An extension for [NatoManga](https://natomanga.com) that enhances the reading experience by adding useful features and removing unnecessary clutter.

## Features

- **Next Full Chapter**: Skip the annoying sliced 42.1, 42.2 and 42.3 and go straight to 43 if available.
- **Manga Preview Popup**: Brings back the preview popup that was removed after the move.
- **Less clutter**: Who needs a paragraph reminding you to bookmark the page before each chapter? And more!
